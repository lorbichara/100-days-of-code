# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will try to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days (or for every day I possibly can).*

#### Start Date
March 15th, 2018.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode (You can follow me @lorbichara)
2. I'll try to not have school code count towards my progress, but if I do something interesting, I'll include it.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
