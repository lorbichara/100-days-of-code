# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Amazon Alexa Skill

**Thoughts:** It was a beginner's [tutorial](https://learn.amazonfutureengineer.com/alexa/fact-skill) but it helped me understand the structure of an Alexa skill. This one gives me facts about my school. Hopefully I'll be able to eventually create more advanced skills!

### Day 2: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Joined the Python train

**Thoughts:** I'm interested in using Python for Data Science, so I thought I'd use some days in this challenge to start learning Python and practice it more. I started with some basic [projects](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/) I found online, and hopefully by the end of this challenge I'll be able to do more interesting projects.

### Day 3: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first pure CSS image

**Thoughts:** This was a very fun project! I've used CSS before for web development projects but this was a different side to CSS for me. I was familiar with pure CSS images, specially the ones in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) but this is my first time creating one. I followed a [tutorial](https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images) suggested by [Brittany Walker](https://medium.com/@brittanyrw/100-days-of-code-challenge-completed-bbce87f04c00) who also did the challenge, but probably tomorrow I'll be trying my own image. This is really exciting! I'm really loving the challenge, and the way I've been able to experiment with a lot of different stuff.

### Day 4: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Python (started working with lists)

**Thoughts:** Today I continued working on simple Python projects, this time, exercises that involved lists. This [website](https://www.practicepython.org/) includes Python exercises. I also experimented with syntax differences between Python 2 and 3. And overall I'm just loving the simplicity of Python, compared to other Object-Oriented Languages I'm more familiar with.

### Day 5: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: (Kinda) Coded a Bitcoin "like" Blockchain

**Thoughts:** My brother sent me a [tutorial](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/code-a-bitcoin-blockchain-in-javascript/) that explains how to code a Bitcoin "like" Blockchain in JavaScript. I got stuck on the testing part, but nonetheless it was useful because it helped me understand a little bit better the whole blockchain concept by actually coding the different parts that make it up.

### Day 6: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Second pure CSS image

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed making my first CSS image (the koala), so today I tried doing my first very own (without following a tutorial). There's still a long way to go, but with practice I hope I can get better, and create better images by the end of the challenge.

### Day 7: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I wanted to learn JavaScript to start including it in my webpages. (Plus, after the Blockchain JS tutorial, even though the syntax was understandable, I thought I should start by learning the basics.) I tried some basic features like write, message boxes, working with the document object, and so far I'm not liking it very much. Some examples didn't work for me, so I need to get better at debugging and understanding JS.
