# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Amazon Alexa Skill

**Thoughts:** It was a beginner's [tutorial](https://learn.amazonfutureengineer.com/alexa/fact-skill) but it helped me understand the structure of an Alexa skill. This one gives me facts about my school. Hopefully I'll be able to eventually create more advanced skills!

### Day 2: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Joined the Python train

**Thoughts:** I'm interested in using Python for Data Science, so I thought I'd use some days in this challenge to start learning Python and practice it more. I started with some basic [projects](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/) I found online, and hopefully by the end of this challenge I'll be able to do more interesting projects.

### Day 3: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first pure CSS image

**Thoughts:** This was a very fun project! I've used CSS before for web development projects but this was a different side to CSS for me. I was familiar with pure CSS images, specially the ones in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) but this is my first time creating one. I followed a [tutorial](https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images) suggested by [Brittany Walker](https://medium.com/@brittanyrw/100-days-of-code-challenge-completed-bbce87f04c00) who also did the challenge, but probably tomorrow I'll be trying my own image. This is really exciting! I'm really loving the challenge, and the way I've been able to experiment with a lot of different stuff.
