# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Amazon Alexa Skill.

**Thoughts:** It was a beginner's [tutorial](https://learn.amazonfutureengineer.com/alexa/fact-skill) but it helped me understand the structure of an Alexa skill. Hopefully I'll be able to eventually create more advanced skills!
