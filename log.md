# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Amazon Alexa Skill.

**Thoughts:** It was a beginner's [tutorial](https://learn.amazonfutureengineer.com/alexa/fact-skill) but it helped me understand the structure of an Alexa skill. This one gives me facts about my school. Hopefully I'll be able to eventually create more advanced skills!

### Day 2: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Joined the Python train.

**Thoughts:** I'm interested in using Python for Data Science, so I thought I'd use some days in this challenge to start learning Python and practice it more. I started with basic [projects](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/) I found online, and hopefully by the end of this challenge I'll be able to do more interesting projects.
