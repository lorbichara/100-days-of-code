# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Amazon Alexa Skill

**Thoughts:** It was a beginner's [tutorial](https://learn.amazonfutureengineer.com/alexa/fact-skill) but it helped me understand the structure of an Alexa skill. This one gives me facts about my school. Hopefully I'll be able to eventually create more advanced skills!

### Day 2: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Joined the Python train

**Thoughts:** I'm interested in using Python for Data Science, so I thought I'd use some days in this challenge to start learning Python and practice it more. I started with some basic [projects](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/) I found online, and hopefully by the end of this challenge I'll be able to do more interesting projects.

### Day 3: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first pure CSS image

**Thoughts:** This was a very fun project! I've used CSS before for web development projects but this was a different side to CSS for me. I was familiar with pure CSS images, specially the ones in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) but this is my first time creating one. I followed a [tutorial](https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images) suggested by [Brittany Walker](https://medium.com/@brittanyrw/100-days-of-code-challenge-completed-bbce87f04c00) who also did the challenge, but probably tomorrow I'll be trying my own image. This is really exciting! I'm really loving the challenge, and the way I've been able to experiment with a lot of different stuff.

### Day 4: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Python (started working with lists)

**Thoughts:** Today I continued working on simple Python projects, this time, exercises that involved lists. This [website](https://www.practicepython.org/) includes Python exercises. I also experimented with syntax differences between Python 2 and 3. And overall I'm just loving the simplicity of Python, compared to other Object-Oriented Languages I'm more familiar with.

### Day 5: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: (Kinda) Coded a Bitcoin "like" Blockchain

**Thoughts:** My brother sent me a [tutorial](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/code-a-bitcoin-blockchain-in-javascript/) that explains how to code a Bitcoin "like" Blockchain in JavaScript. I got stuck on the testing part, but nonetheless it was useful because it helped me understand a little bit better the whole blockchain concept by actually coding the different parts that make it up.

### Day 6: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Second pure CSS image

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed making my first CSS image (the koala), so today I tried doing my first very own (without following a tutorial). There's still a long way to go, but with practice I hope I can get better, and create better images by the end of the challenge.

### Day 7: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I wanted to learn JavaScript to start including it in my webpages. (Plus, after the Blockchain JS tutorial, even though the syntax was understandable, I thought I should start by learning the basics.) I tried some basic features like write, message boxes, working with the document object, and so far I'm not liking it very much. Some examples didn't work for me, so I need to get better at debugging and understanding JS.

### Day 8: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problems

**Thoughts:** I went back to basics with some LeetCode problems. I've never been one to solve problems there for fun (usually only when it was for school), so today I decided to try it. I tried three diferent easy problems, but got stuck in one. For the two problems that were accepted, my runtime wasn't the best so I'll keep practicing to improve.

### Day 9: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problems

**Thoughts:** I continued with more LeetCode problems today! This time I was able to complete 5 problems (3 more than yesterday, one in SQL and the rest in C++), and for one, I even came up with another solution that beat my original runtime.

### Day 10: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problems

**Thoughts:** Yes, I solved more LeetCode problems today. Only this time, I checked the Discussion tab to see how others solved the problem so it helped me to see a different way of solving it.

* [Judge Route Cycle](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/JudgeRouteCycle.cpp)

### Day 11: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ketnipz Bean

**Thoughts:** I started drawing the [Ketnipz](https://www.instagram.com/ketnipz/) Bean on CSS. Still not done, and it's still looking a bit weird, but I'll keep working on it.

### Day 12: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ketnipz Bean

**Thoughts:** I continued with the Bean from yesterday, and it's still looking weird! I need to get better at CSS to make the figures look more like the original.

### Day 13: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cracking the Coding Interview Problems

**Thoughts:** I've solved some CtCI problems when practicing for interviews, but today I decided to practice them again. After coming up with a solution, I took the time to check for the proposed solutions and try to implement them myself, to learn more. Although today I only completed 1 problem (with several solutions), I'll continue working through the problems of the book.
