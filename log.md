# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first Amazon Alexa Skill

**Thoughts:** It was a beginner's [tutorial](https://learn.amazonfutureengineer.com/alexa/fact-skill) but it helped me understand the structure of an Alexa skill. This one gives me facts about my school. Hopefully I'll be able to eventually create more advanced skills!

### Day 2: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Joined the Python train

**Thoughts:** I'm interested in using Python for Data Science, so I thought I'd use some days in this challenge to start learning Python and practice it more. I started with some basic [projects](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/) I found online, and hopefully by the end of this challenge I'll be able to do more interesting projects.

* [MadLib](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Python/MadLib.py)

### Day 3: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created my first pure CSS image

**Thoughts:** This was a very fun project! I've used CSS before for web development projects but this was a different side to CSS for me. I was familiar with pure CSS images, specially the ones in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) but this is my first time creating one. I followed a [tutorial](https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images) suggested by [Brittany Walker](https://medium.com/@brittanyrw/100-days-of-code-challenge-completed-bbce87f04c00) who also did the challenge, but probably tomorrow I'll be trying my own image. This is really exciting! I'm really loving the challenge, and the way I've been able to experiment with a lot of different stuff.

### Day 4: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Python (started working with lists)

**Thoughts:** Today I continued working on simple Python projects, this time, exercises that involved lists. This [website](https://www.practicepython.org/) includes Python exercises. I also experimented with syntax differences between Python 2 and 3. And overall I'm just loving the simplicity of Python, compared to other Object-Oriented Languages I'm more familiar with.

### Day 5: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: (Kinda) Coded a Bitcoin "like" Blockchain

**Thoughts:** My brother sent me a [tutorial](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/code-a-bitcoin-blockchain-in-javascript/) that explains how to code a Bitcoin "like" Blockchain in JavaScript. I got stuck on the testing part, but nonetheless it was useful because it helped me understand a little bit better the whole blockchain concept by actually coding the different parts that make it up.

### Day 6: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Second pure CSS image

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed making my first CSS image (the koala), so today I tried doing my first very own (without following a tutorial). There's still a long way to go, but with practice I hope I can get better, and create better images by the end of the challenge.

### Day 7: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I wanted to learn JavaScript to start including it in my webpages. (Plus, after the Blockchain JS tutorial, even though the syntax was understandable, I thought I should start by learning the basics.) I tried some basic features like write, message boxes, working with the document object, and so far I'm not liking it very much. Some examples didn't work for me, so I need to get better at debugging and understanding JS.

### Day 8: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problems

**Thoughts:** I went back to basics with some LeetCode problems. I've never been one to solve problems there for fun (usually only when it was for school), so today I decided to try it. I tried three diferent easy problems, but got stuck in one. For the two problems that were accepted, my runtime wasn't the best so I'll keep practicing to improve.

### Day 9: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problems

**Thoughts:** I continued with more LeetCode problems today! This time I was able to complete 5 problems (3 more than yesterday, one in SQL and the rest in C++), and for one, I even came up with another solution that beat my original runtime.

### Day 10: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problems

**Thoughts:** Yes, I solved more LeetCode problems today. Only this time, I checked the Discussion tab to see how others solved the problem so it helped me to see a different way of solving it.

### Day 11: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ketnipz Bean

**Thoughts:** I started drawing the [Ketnipz](https://www.instagram.com/ketnipz/) Bean on CSS. Still not done, and it's still looking a bit weird, but I'll keep working on it.

**Link to work:** [Ketnipz Bean](https://codepen.io/lorbichara/full/WzZpVQ) (Still not done)

### Day 12: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ketnipz Bean

**Thoughts:** I continued with the Bean from yesterday, and it's still looking weird! I need to get better at CSS to make the figures look more like the original.

**Link to work:** [Ketnipz Bean](https://codepen.io/lorbichara/full/WzZpVQ) (Still not done) (It actually looks pretty funny)

### Day 13: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cracking the Coding Interview Problems

**Thoughts:** I've solved some CtCI problems when practicing for interviews, but today I decided to practice them again. After coming up with a solution, I took the time to check for the proposed solutions and try to implement them myself, to learn more. Although today I only completed 1 problem (with several solutions), I'll continue working through the problems of the book.

**Link to work:** [IsUnique](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/IsUnique.cpp)

### Day 14: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CtCI Problems

**Thoughts:** Woo! 2 weeks of the challenge already! 
Yes, I solved more Cracking the Coding Interview Problems today. I'm taking advantage of this challenge to start practicing up for recruiting season next semester instead of waiting till August to start panicking.

* [Check Permutation](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/CheckPermutation.cpp)
* [URLify](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/URLify.cpp)

### Day 15: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More CtCI Problems

**Thoughts:** I did more CtCI problems today. Each day I'm feeling more confident with this book, and I think I'm getting faster at coming up with good solutions.

**Links to work:**
* [Check Permutation](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/CheckPermutation.cpp) (I included two new solutions for this problem.)
* [Palindrome Permutation](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/PalindromePermutation.cpp) (This one seemed so hard when I first read it, but a minute later I was able to come up with a clever solution!)

### Day 16: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cracking the Coding Interview Problem

**Thoughts:** I continued with another CtCI problem. I'm having fun coming up with one or several solutions, and then comparing them to the ones proposed in the book, and try to implement them myself. I also feel that I'm learning a lot, and that it'll help me in the long run.

### Day 17: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cracking the Coding Interview Problem

**Thoughts:** The same as the previous 4 days. I used to dread this book because it meant recruiting season = stress for me, but now working through it without the stress of recruiting season, makes it more friendly.

**Link to work:** [String Compression](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/StringCompression.cpp)

### Day 17: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cracking the Coding Interview Problem

**Thoughts:** Today I continued with the same problem I was working on yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I solved yet another CtCI problem.

**Link to work:** [String Rotation](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/StringRotation.cpp)

### Day 19: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Google Code Jam Practice

**Thoughts:** Today I registered for Google's Code Jam! I saw a tweet and decided to try it. Qualification Round begins till Friday but I thought I would practice with problems from past contests. I tried problem A from the Qualification Round from 2017 and it was challenging, but at the end it turned out with help from the algorithm proposed by [Gopinath](http://gopinaths.gitlab.io/post/oversized_pancake_flipper/), and both of my Small and Large inputs were accepted.

### Day 20: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode/CtCI Problem

**Thoughts:** Today I practiced a Linked List problem from LeetCode that also appears on CtCI.

**Link to work:** [Linked List Cycle Start](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/LinkedLists/CycleStart.cpp)

### Day 21: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: CtCI Problem

**Thoughts:** WE HIT 3 WEEKS! THAT'S 21 DAYS! (A myth says that it takes 21 days to build a habit.) I'm not sure how to classify if something is a habit or not, but what I'm sure is that today, I started coding for today's challenge when I got sick of studying. So yeah, I took a break from studying to code. That had never happened before! 

**Link to work:** [Kth To Last Node](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/CtCI/KthToLastNode.cpp)

### Day 22: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode/CtCI Problem

**Thoughts:** Today I tried other solutions for the problems for the previous 2 days, and tried a new one that appears both in CtCi and LeetCode.

**Link to work:** [Intersection](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/LinkedLists/Intersection.cpp)

### Day 23: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode/CtCI Problem

**Thoughts:** I completed yet another LeetCode/CtCI problem. I think I'm actually getting better because I've been coming up with better answers in less time! Also, whenever I complete a problem with my own solution, I try checking out other solutions and sometimes implementing them and I think that's helping me. I'm no longer terrified of CtCI!

**Link to work:** [Palindrome](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/LinkedLists/Palindrome.cpp)

### Day 24: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Problem

**Thoughts:** A simple problem completed today since there's a lot of homework that needed to be done, but I didn't want to miss today!

**Link to work:** [Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/LinkedLists/RemoveDuplicatesSorted.cpp)

### Day 25: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Project Euler

**Thoughts:** Someone once recommended Project Euler, so I decided to give it a try today.

**Link to work:** [Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/ProjectEuler/SmallestMultiple.cpp)

### Day 26: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Project Euler Problems

**Thoughts:** Today I continued with more Project Euler Problems! They're fun, although I think my solutions aren't efficient AT ALL! I need to work on that.

**Links to work:**
* [Sum Square Difference](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/ProjectEuler/SumSquare.cpp)

### Day 27: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Project Euler Problems

**Thoughts:** I'm finding these problems very interesting! If I can't get to the answer of one at a given time, I'm left all day thinking about how to solve it till I have time to code again!

**Links to work:**
* [Largest Prime Factor](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/ProjectEuler/LargestPrimeFactor.cpp)

### Day 28: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Project Euler Problem

**Thoughts:** Ahhhh today I tried two Project Euler problems and I wasn't able to solve them yet!! I even learned a formula to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, and still nothing...

### Day 29: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Encrypting/Decrypting Agent Files

**Thoughts:** This was an assignment for school but it took me the afternoon and it was interesting so I decided to add it. We created this Agent Management System, and now we had to encrypt/decrypt files with agent's information. (In C)

**Links to work:** [Encryption](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Encryption.c)

### Day 30: April 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: LeetCode Math Problem

**Thoughts:** Today was another LeetCode kind of day... It was a math problem and at first I came up with a very non-efficient solution, but after doing some research, I found a formula that calculates the answer much more faster.

**Links to work:** [Add Digits](https://github.com/lorbichara/100-days-of-code/blob/master/C++/LeetCode/AddDigits.cpp)
